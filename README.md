# Curvature-Constrained Vector Field for Motion Planning of Nonholonomic Robots
 
This research focuses on navigating the 2D nonholonomic robot featuring an upper bound on the trajectory curvature to the target configuration via the curvature-constrained vector field (CVF) and the saturated control law with dynamic gain.

In this repository, we provide the source codes for the Simulation Verification (corresponding to Section V.A in the paper), Algorithm Comparison (Section V.B), Experiments on Ackermann UGV (Section VI.A) and Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIL) Experiments on Fixed-Wing UAV (Section V.B).

For the Simulation Verification, run the first simulation example with "RUN_Example.m".
